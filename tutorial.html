    <h1 style="color: red;background-color: orange; text-decoration: underline;" >Roles</h1>
    <ul style="color: red;background-color: orange;">
      <li>★ <span style="font-weight: bold;">Marksman</span> is a type of role that has a high attack/damage and critical attacks froma far range.Marksman plays an important role in the game by defeating enemies from a distance.</li>
      <li>★ <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tank</span> is a type of role that has high HP and high defense while having a very low attack. This position is always at the front by acting as a shield against enemies, taking the damage.</li>
      <li>★ <span style="font-weight: bold;">Support</span> heroes protect their allies in battles. Their main role is to aid their teammates. Support heroes help mobile legends heroes that are less durable and easy to kill, such as the marksman heroes.</li>
      <li>★ <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fighter</span> is a role that carries a mix of capabilities in battle, including defensive and offensive stats. Even though Fighters aren't known for being the starters in team fights or the one with most damage, their skills may soon turn into a major threat.</li>
      <li>★ <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mage</span> cause damage to nearby enemies using magic. Given this, mage heroes are highly important in any team. Their main strength is not their physical attack but their ability effects.</li>
      <li>★ <span style="font-weight: bold;">Assassin</span> is very agile that specializes in killing or disabling roaming targets picking them of as they try to replenish HP. Assassins choose their targets and aim at them carefully. </li>

    <h1 style="color: red;background-color: orange; text-decoration: underline;">Tips and Tricks</h1>
    <ol type="1" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);background-color: orange;">
      <li>❖ Before using a hero in an actual match, gamers are advised to first read the hero's skills. If reading is too much trouble, players can also utilize the Training Ground to try the hero's out. To access it, open the Training Camp and choose Practice.</li>
      <li>❖ Throughout each match, players can check everyone's equipment. This may seem overwhelming for beginners, but it's a crucial habit to have. In Mobile Legends, there are three types of damage; Magic, Physical, and True Damage. Each has a counter of its own.</li>
      <li>❖ Hitting Turret Grants Gold. In the first five minutes of the game, if players are handling a Lane, it's important to remember that the protected Turret will grant Gold if it's damaged.</li>
      <li>❖ Do not attack a turret if there is no minions in range of the turret. You will take huge amount of damage attacking the turret without the minion in range.</li>
      <li>❖ Constantly look at the map. If we keep an eye on the minimap, we can avoid being ganked or alert our team of a potential enemy ganks. </li>
      <li>❖ Turrets before kills.</li>
      <li>❖ When you want to gank, you always have to communicate and make sure it's at least 4 of you, so you have a higher chance of winning the gank without deaths, and everyone can go back to their lanes.</li>
